 Healthcare Billing Prediction Model
This repository contains a machine learning model that predicts the billing amount for patients based on their medical and demographic information. The goal is to assist healthcare providers, insurers, and analysts in forecasting costs, optimizing resources, and identifying financial trends in patient care.
 Project Overview
Healthcare costs can vary significantly based on several factors such as age, test results, diagnosis, and more. This model uses supervised learning techniques to predict the billing amount for a sick person, helping improve transparency and cost management in the healthcare system.

🚀 Features
Predicts medical billing amount based on patient data

Supports integration via a REST API (Flask/FastAPI)

Preprocessing and feature engineering included

Trained and evaluated using real-world healthcare data

📊 Input Features
The model uses features such as:

Age

Gender

Diagnosis/Test Results

Number of Visits or Treatments

Insurance Type

Hospital Location

Length of Stay

Any other relevant attributes in your dataset

(You can list the actual features from your dataset here.)

🧠 Model
The model is trained using [your chosen ML algorithm, e.g., XGBoost, Random Forest, Linear Regression] and evaluated using metrics like:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

R² Score
